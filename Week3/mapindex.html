		<h2>Description</h2>
        Since I was born, traveling has been a huge part of my life. From being born in a different country to 
        traveling each break from school, I have grown to love traveling and seeing the world.
        In this site, I will be presenting a small list of various locations I have been to, restricted
        to the North American region. Follow along with my journey across the globe!
