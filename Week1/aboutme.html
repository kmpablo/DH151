            Introduction
        </h2>
        Hi there! My name is <b>Keona Mae Pablo</b> and I am a fourth year cognitive science
        major and digital humanities minor at UCLA. I am from a small town in California 
        about 3 hours north of LA named Santa Maria. One fun fact about me is that 
        I enjoy building video games as a hobby (I have created two so far and working on one 
        right now!). I currently work as a project manager for the UCLA DataSquad and an Accessibility
        Engineer for the UCLA Disabilites and Computing Programs. I am also a board member at
        <a href="https://www.creativelabsucla.com/"style="color:#D3CDD7">Creative Labs</a>. When I am not studying, you can find me exploring Los Angeles, playing video games, 
        or building Lego Architectures! If you want to learn more about me, check out my

        <h2>Goals for this course</h2>
        In this course, I am really excited to learn some new technologies and expand my 
        knowledge in digital tools. I have been wanting to learn some JavaScript for a while
        and I believe this is a really fun way to go about it. I have also learned some GIS technologies
        in other classes and I think it would be interesting to deepen my understanding of maps
        and the innovative ways maps can tell stories.
